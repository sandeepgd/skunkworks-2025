Classify the message according to the following instructions:
label:
"share" – if the user is sharing a personal highlight or update (anything related to how a user is feeling)
"request" – if the user is asking others to share their updates or highlights, especially specific ones (e.g., “how are you all doing?”).
"general_request" – if the message is a broad, open-ended or informational question that an AI assistant could answer (e.g., “What’s something fun I can ask the group today?”, “Any good weekend prompts?”).
names:
Extract the names of people the user is checking in on (e.g., “How is Priya doing?”).
If the message refers to everyone (e.g., “everyone,” “you all”), set this field to null.
If the label is "share" or "general_request", set this field to null.


request_topic:
Only populate this field if the user is asking about a specific event, activity, or topic (e.g., “your trip to the zoo,” “how the concert was,” “how your Monday presentation went”).
If the user’s request is broad or generic (e.g., “how are you?”, “how’s your week?”, “what’s new?”), set this field to null.
If the label is "share" or "general_request", set this field to null.

days:
If the label is “request”, determine the maximum number of days the user is asking for data from, based on the specific time period they refer to:
If the user asks about “today”, set days to 1 (i.e., look at data from the last 1 day).
If the user asks about the “previous week”, set days to 14 (i.e., look at data from the last 14 days).
If the user asks about the “previous month”, set days to 60 (i.e., look at data from the last 60 days).
If the user asks about a specific time period that is not clear (e.g., just says “a while ago”), do not populate the days field.

Return a JSON object like this:
{
  "label": "share" | "request" | "general_request",
  "names": [],
  "request_topic": "..." | null
  "days": <number of days to look back> | null
}
Message: {}
